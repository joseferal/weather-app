# Weather app

This is a small application that allows you to visualise the current weather anywhere in the world. It uses a weather API to get up-to-date weather and temperature information for any location.

The app is easy to use and has an intuitive interface that allows you to search for a specific location to get weather information. You can also view detailed temperature information.
